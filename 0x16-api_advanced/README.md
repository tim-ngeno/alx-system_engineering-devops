## How to Use an API with Pagination

Pagination is a common technique used in APIs to manage large datasets. It allows you to retrieve data in manageable chunks.

### Why Use Pagination

Pagination prevents overwhelming your application by breaking up data into smaller portions. It's crucial for working with APIs that return large result sets.

### Pagination Parameters

- **Page**: Specifies the page number you want to retrieve.
- **Limit**: Determines the number of items per page.
- **Offset**: Specifies the starting point for a page.
- **Next Page Token**: A token that indicates the next page of results.

### Example: Paginating through API Results

Suppose you're working with a paginated API like a social media feed. Here's how you can paginate through results in Python:

```python
import requests

url = 'https://api.example.com/posts'
page = 1
limit = 10

while True:
    response = requests.get(url, params={'page': page, 'limit': limit})
    data = response.json()

    for item in data['items']:
        # Process each item here

    if 'next' in data:
        page += 1
    else:
        break
```

## How to Parse JSON Results from an API

JSON is the most common data format in API responses. Parsing JSON allows you to extract and use meaningful information.

### Why Parse JSON

JSON parsing is essential for extracting data from API responses. It allows your application to work with structured data.

### Example: Parsing JSON Data

Let's say you receive a JSON response from an API like this:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
}
```

You can parse it in Python like this:

```python
import json

response_json = '{"name": "John Doe", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}'
data = json.loads(response_json)

name = data['name']
age = data['age']
city = data['city']
```

### Handling Nested JSON Structures

API responses often contain nested objects and arrays. You can navigate and extract data from complex JSON structures using libraries like `json` in Python.

## How to Make a Recursive API Call

Recursive API calls are necessary when you need to fetch data based on the results of previous API calls.

### When to Use Recursive API Calls

Recursive calls are helpful for scenarios like traversing hierarchical data structures, building graphs, or managing parent-child relationships.

### Example: Recursive API Calls

Let's say you're building a tree structure where each node represents data retrieved from an API. You can use a recursive function in Python to construct the tree efficiently.

```python
def build_tree(node_id):
    data = fetch_data(node_id)
    if data:
        node = process_data(data)
        children = data.get('children', [])
        for child_id in children:
            child_node = build_tree(child_id)
            node.add_child(child_node)
        return node
```

### Implementing Recursive Logic

In the example above, `build_tree` recursively fetches and processes data, adding child nodes to construct a tree.

## How to Sort a Dictionary by Value

Sorting a dictionary by value is a useful skill for working with data structures.

### Why Sort a Dictionary

Sorting a dictionary allows you to arrange data based on values, facilitating data analysis and presentation.

### Example: Sorting a Dictionary by Value

Suppose you have a dictionary of products with prices. You can sort it by price in Python like this:

```python
products = {'apple': 2.99, 'banana': 1.99, 'orange': 3.49}
sorted_products = {k: v for k, v in sorted(products.items(), key=lambda item: item[1])}
```

### Custom Sorting Functions

Custom sorting functions allow you to tailor the sorting process. You can specify your own criteria for sorting dictionaries.
