## Introduction to HTTPS
**HTTPS** stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It's the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between a browser and the website you're connected to. The 'S' in HTTPS means all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted, providing an added layer of security.

## Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) / Transport Layer Security (TLS)

SSL and its successor, TLS, are cryptographic protocols designed to provide end-to-end security over networks. They are essential for protecting web traffic from eavesdroppers, ensuring that data remains confidential and untouched.

### Two Main Elements Provided by SSL

1. **Authentication**: SSL provides proof that the server is who it claims to be. This verification prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and establishes user trust.

2. **Encryption**: Encryption ensures that any data (like personal information or credentials) exchanged between the client and server remains confidential and tamper-proof.

### Purpose of Encrypting Traffic

Encrypting traffic is crucial for:

- **Data Privacy**: Ensuring that sensitive information (like passwords, credit card numbers, or personal details) remains confidential.
  
- **Integrity**: Making sure data hasn't been tampered with during transit.
  
- **Authentication**: Confirming that you're communicating with the intended website and not a malicious entity.

### SSL Termination

SSL Termination refers to the process where an intermediary device (like a load balancer) handles the SSL encryption/decryption, relieving the end-server from the computational burden. The traffic between the client and this intermediary device is encrypted, while between the device and the server, it's in plain text.

## HAProxy SSL Termination on Ubuntu 16.04

HAProxy is a widely-used load balancer and proxy server. One of its key features is SSL termination. Setting it up on Ubuntu 16.04 involves configuring HAProxy to handle the SSL encryption and decryption, ensuring backend servers only deal with unencrypted traffic. This offloads the computational overhead of SSL from the server to the HAProxy, improving performance.

## Bash Function (Overview)

While the guide mainly focuses on HTTPS and SSL/TLS concepts, it's essential to understand Bash functions for scripting tasks. A Bash function is a block of reusable code designed to perform a particular task, streamlining repetitive tasks and making scripts more organized.
