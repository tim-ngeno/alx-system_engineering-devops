# Sniffing Network Traffic with `tcpdump`

Ever wondered how the internet, with all its memes, cat videos, and online shopping, keeps your credit card details or email passwords safe? That's all thanks to the magic of network security. Imagine a world where, every time you send a message or buy something online, there's a sneaky eavesdropper grabbing all that info. Not cool, right?

With the network script [`user_authenticating_into_server`](https://github.com/tim-ngeno/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/attack_is_the_best_defense/user_authenticating_into_server), here's a step-by-step guide to see what kind of info it's sending out:

## Steps to Extract Passwords from Network Traffic

### 1. **Capture the Network Traffic**
Before anything else, you need to "listen in" on the network traffic generated by your script.
To do this magic trick, we use `tcpdump`. Fire up your terminal and type:
```bash
sudo tcpdump -i any -w output.pcap
```
What this does is capture all traffic from every network interface and dump it into a file named `output.pcap`.

### 2. **Run the Script**
With `tcpdump` doing its thing, run your `user_authenticating_into_server` script in a different terminal window:
```bash
./user_authenticating_into_server
```
Let the script do its job till it's done.

### 3. **Analyze the Captured Traffic**
Done with the capture? Stop `tcpdump` (hit `Ctrl+C`). Now, to the fun part: sifting through the data. While `tcpdump` can show you the raw data, tools like Wireshark make it more readable. But if you're a `tcpdump` kind of person:
```bash
tcpdump -r output.pcap -A
```
This decodes the captured packets, showing you the human-readable parts.

### 4. **Look for the Password**
Get your detective hat on. Scan the decoded data for patterns that smell like username/password pairs or any sequence that screams "password". A good clue? Lines like "Authentication failed: Bad username / password".

### 5. **Record the Password**
Found something that looks like a password? Note it down or save it somewhere safe. You're going to need it.

### 6. **Decode the Password**
If you suspect the password is Base64 encoded, it's time to decode it. Here's a quick Python trick to do just that:
```python
import base64

encoded_password = "YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD"
decoded_password = base64.b64decode(encoded_password).decode()
print(decoded_password)
```

Or simply use the builtin linux `base64` utility:
```bash
echo -n "YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD" | base64 -d
```
Replace `YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_PASSWORD` with the password you found.

# Dictionary Attack using Hydra: A Step-by-Step Guide

Password-based authentication systems have been a mainstay in digital security. However, when passwords are weak or commonly used, these systems can be vulnerable to dictionary attacks. This guide will walk you through a practical exercise of launching a dictionary attack against an SSH account using Hydra, inside a Docker container environment.

## Prerequisites:

- A machine running Ubuntu.
- Basic familiarity with the terminal, Docker, and security concepts.

## Steps to Execute a Dictionary Attack:

### 1. **Setting Up Docker**:

Before we delve into the attack, you need to have Docker installed and running on your Ubuntu machine.

1. Install Docker:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io
```
2. Start and enable Docker:
```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

### 2. **Pull and Run Docker Image**:

Next, pull the specific Docker image we'll be testing against and run it.

```bash
docker pull sylvainkalache/264-1
docker run -p 2222:22 -d -ti sylvainkalache/264-1
```
This command maps port `22` inside the Docker container to port `2222` on your local machine.

### 3. **Obtain a Password Dictionary**:

For dictionary attacks, you need... well, a dictionary. This is a list of potential passwords to test. There are various password dictionaries available online, such as the famous `rockyou.txt`. Download your chosen dictionary to your local machine. You might want to use multiple dictionaries for a more extensive attack.

### 4. **Install and Set Up Hydra**:

Hydra is a powerful tool for dictionary attacks. Here's how you install and set it up:

```bash
sudo apt install hydra
```

### 5. **Execute the Dictionary Attack**:

With everything set up, it's time to launch the attack. Given our hint that the password is 11 characters long, you can filter your dictionary for words of this length (though this is optional):

```bash
awk 'length == 11' your-password-dictionary.txt > filtered_passwords.txt
```

Now, launch Hydra:

```bash
hydra -l sylvain -P filtered_passwords.txt 127.0.0.1 -s 2222 ssh
```

This command instructs Hydra to attempt logging in as user `sylvain`, using the passwords in `filtered_passwords.txt`, targeting IP `127.0.0.1` on port `2222` with the `ssh` protocol.

### 6. **Review Results**:

Hydra will display its progress and will notify you of any successful login attempts. Note down any successful password matches and, for security reasons, always ensure you change these passwords to something stronger in real-world scenarios.

Remember, always ensure you have the right authorizations, and never target systems you don't own or don't have explicit consent to test. Use these tools responsibly and ethically.
