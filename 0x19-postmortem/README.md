# Web Stack Outage Postmortem üö®

## Issue Summary:

**Duration:**
- *Start Time:* November 11, 2023, 15:45 UTC
- *End Time:* November 11, 2023, 18:30 UTC

**Impact:**
- *Service Affected:* User Authentication System
- *User Experience:* 80% of users experienced the cosmic frustration of being unable to log in, leading to a temporary online identity crisis.

**Root Cause:**
- The villain of the day? A misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, orchestrating chaos in the delicate ballet of authentication requests.

## Timeline:

- **15:45 UTC:** Anomalies detected, as if the web gods whispered, "Houston, we have a problem."

- **15:50 UTC:** Alert sirens blared, summoning our valiant engineers to embark on a quest for digital salvation.

- **16:00 UTC:** Initial suspicion pointed fingers at the database. A health check ensued, finding it healthier than a kale smoothie.

- **16:15 UTC:** Shifted focus to the network realm. Firewalls and routing tables scrutinized like detectives at a crime scene.

- **16:45 UTC:** A detour into the network wilderness, following misleading signs like breadcrumbs leading into the woods.

- **17:00 UTC:** Distress signals reached the Network Operations Center (NOC). A call for reinforcements from the digital Avengers.

- **17:30 UTC:** Eureka! The load balancer was found playing hide-and-seek, misrouting like a GPS with a mischievous sense of humor.

- **18:00 UTC:** Load balancer scolded and settings corrected. Authentication requests back on the right path.

- **18:30 UTC:** Victory! User authentication service restored, and error rates returned to their peaceful slumber.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

**Root Cause:**
- The load balancer, having partied too hard with recent updates, stumbled over its own feet - a misapplied routing rule.

**Resolution:**
- Load balancer settings rolled back to its last stable version, with automated tests enlisted as the gatekeepers for future updates.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

**Improvements/Fixes:**
1. **Configuration Management Review:**
   - A deep dive into configuration management processes, preventing misconfigurations from gatecrashing future updates.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Monitoring expanded to keep an eagle eye on load balancer health and routing sanity, detecting anomalies before they throw a digital tantrum.

3. **Documentation Update:**
   - Documentation revamped to be the Yoda of load balancer configurations‚Äîclear, wise, and preventing missteps.

**Tasks to Address the Issue:**
1. **Automated Testing for Load Balancer Configurations:**
   - Automated tests enlisted as the load balancer's personal bouncer, ensuring only the well-behaved configurations get through.

2. **Regular Configuration Audits:**
   - Scheduled audits to keep load balancer configurations in check, avoiding rebellious misconfigurations.

3. **Incident Response Training:**
   - Engineers donning their superhero capes, training sessions initiated to sharpen troubleshooting skills and root cause analysis superpowers.

4. **Communication Protocols:**
   - Reviewed and fortified communication protocols, ensuring messages traverse the digital grapevine with Flash-like speed during incidents.

5. **Post-Incident Review:**
   - A Sherlock Holmes-style investigation into the incident, gathering insights and lessons learned, refining the orchestra of incident response.

In conclusion, the web stack faced a day of misadventures, with the load balancer playing the role of the mischievous trickster. Swift corrective actions, automated guards, and a sprinkle of humor shall stand guard against similar digital escapades in the future. May the web gods smile favorably upon us! üåêüõ°Ô∏è
