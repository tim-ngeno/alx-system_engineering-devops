Explanation and Addressing Specifics:

Firewalls:
- Added for network security, controlling incoming and outgoing traffic.

SSL Certificate (HTTPS):
- SSL certificate secures the communication between the user's browser and the server using HTTPS.

Monitoring Clients (Data Collectors):
- Collect data for monitoring, including server performance and user activity.

Load Balancer:
- Distributes traffic among servers for load balancing and high availability.

Why Firewalls:
- Firewalls protect against unauthorized access and help create a secure network environment.

Why HTTPS:
- HTTPS encrypts data in transit, ensuring data confidentiality and preventing eavesdropping and tampering.

Why Monitoring:
- Monitoring helps track server performance, identify issues, and optimize resources.

How Monitoring Collects Data:
- Monitoring tools collect data through agents or data collectors installed on servers. They track metrics like CPU, memory, response times, etc.

Monitoring Web Server QPS:
- To monitor QPS (Queries Per Second), use monitoring tools to track incoming requests and response times on the web server.


Issues:

- Terminating SSL at Load Balancer Level:
This can introduce a security risk as data would be decrypted at the load balancer before being re-encrypted for the internal network.

- Single MySQL Server Accepting Writes:
If the MySQL server fails, write operations are affected.

- Servers with All Same Components:
It could result in a single point of failure; if one component fails (e.g., database), all servers are impacted.
