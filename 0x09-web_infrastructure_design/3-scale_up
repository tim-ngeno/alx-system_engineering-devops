- Load Balancer Cluster:
  - Load balancers are added for distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers.
  - A load balancer cluster provides redundancy and ensures high availability.
  - If one load balancer fails, the other can continue serving traffic.

- Server 1 and Server 2:
  - Separate servers are used for improved isolation and redundancy.
  - Each server hosts its own set of components: Nginx, App Server, and Database.

- Nginx:
  - Acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer for distributing requests.
  - Helps offload SSL termination and efficiently handle incoming traffic.

- App Server:
  - Processes dynamic content and application logic.
  - Splitting components onto separate servers can enhance performance and fault tolerance.

- Database:
  - Separate databases for each server enhance fault tolerance and isolation.
  - Splitting the database instances can distribute the load and reduce contention.

The architecture follows best practices for scalability, redundancy, and isolation by separating components onto different servers and setting up a load balancer cluster.
